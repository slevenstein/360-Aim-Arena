Shoot as many spinning eyeballs before time runs out. Timer starts once you shoot the first eyeball. That's it!
(make sure to open your terminal in another tab to check your score and watch the timer)

*if you want to play at a different sensitivity or resolution, run ./project in the location of the folder with additional arguments for sens and/or res like this:

./project 1 1280 720

or this(with just sens)... 

./project 1

or even this(with just res)...

./project 1280 720

(run ./build.py to build project.exe)

Enjoy!
